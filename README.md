# Welcome to store-n-share

Store-and-Share is simple, but useful app that allows user to upload/store their data. 

# Setting up Frontend (React)
To set up front end, simply go to the ```'STORE-N-SHARE/reactapp'```. Then on the command line, do ```npm install```.


# Setting up Backend (Flask)
To set up back end, simply go to the ```'STORE-N-SHARE/flask-backend'```. Then on the command line, do ```python3 -m venv venv``` to create a virtual environment. Then to activate, do ```source venv/bin/activate```. After being activated, please install Flask by doing ```pip3 install Flask```.


# How to test?
After setting the above two steps, you are ready to test my app. Please have two terminals ready. On one terminal, activate the virtual environment inside of the 'flask-backend' folder, then type ```python3 backend.py```. Please make sure it is running on localhost:5000. 
Then, move on to the 'reactapp' folder, simply do ```npm start``` to deploy and start testing my app.

# Something to note
There might be some modules that need to be downloaded. If the error says 'no module found' or 'cannot import {module name}' then please install them by ```npm install {module name}``` if react, or ```pip install {module name}``` if flask.
